This file is here to serve as a place holder.

I usually like to have a src/ directory to store all of the actual code in a project.
Just to better differentiate between code and other resources.

Installation:
Need a higher version of pygame than what comes with the basic pip install:

* python3.7 -m pip install --user pygame==2.0.0.dev6
* python3.7 -m pip install Pillow
* python3.7 -m pip install PyOpenGL
* python3.7 -m pip install PyOpenGL-accelerate
